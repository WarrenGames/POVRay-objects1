This repository contains several objects you can use freely for any 
purpose ( commercial, educational or personal use ) with the POVRay
raytracer, that you can download on this web site: https://www.povray.org
The objects are the following:
	Some glass jars with their macros
	Mushrooms
	An outdoor lamp
	A space crate
	A tool box
	A rustic well
	
All the objects use modern 'srgb color' system from POVRay. There is a 
demo scene with each object and each include file is independant from 
any other file to include. I tried to prefix every sub parts of the
objects to avoid collisions with any other previous declarations in a 
scene.
